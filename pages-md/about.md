## Who am I?

Hi! I'm Lorenzo. I was born in 1999. I live in Bologna, Italy.

I'm a developer and a general tech nerd.

I graduated from Università di Bologna in Laurea Triennale in Ingegneria e Scienze Informatiche.

I like to play around with web and game development, mainly with web technologies. Like the ones that you're using to read this page!
