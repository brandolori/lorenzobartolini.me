How did this site come to be?

I reserved this domain (lorenzobartolini.me) last december, seeing as the .it and .com domain were both already taken, and I was worried I'd be left without an available domain. Back then I didn't really have any ideas on what to do with it, but I was confident it would end up useful eventually.

So come this winter, I wanted to find a place to both show off all the cool tricks I learn and write short blog stories talking about my experiences. I remembered I had this site, that I only had been using to test npm packages in a production setting, and I decided to do something with it.

Here's how it looked back then:

## The concept
Ok, the website had to have a few features:
1. be a tech showcase
2. have a simple design
3. be a place where I can write about some new tech I just found out, or a recent happening
4. be fun to create!

## The tech
The base architecture is based on [this video](https://youtu.be/pY0vWYLDDco) from youtube creator Ben Awad. It utilized nextjs' SSG (Static Site Generation) to dynamically create pages based on markdown files present on a folder in the project structure. You're reading a Markdown file right now!

For the background, which was the fun part of the project, I wanted to build something with [threejs](https://threejs.org/). Looking around I found that the smartest way to go about doing it looked like using [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), a React renderer fot threejs scenes. And I was stunned! Building a 3d scene looked as simple as building ah html (actually jsx ðŸ˜‰) page!

## The design
So, I am not a designer. From the get go, I knew that if I wanted to build something nice, I had to keep it simple (hence the second point in the features list).
The first decision was on the typography: I went about tackling this task through the old art of _taking inspiration_ from somone else's work.

I settled on a sans-serif default system font for the paragraph was a good idea, as it will blend in with what the user is used to seeing, and will also help load the page faster, and **Rubik** for the titles. It looked really nice, expecialy with the orange theme that I had decided on.

Fun fact: the precise color (#FFA500) was chosen because I grew fond of the default CSS "orange" color, that I was using for testing.

## Deep dive: the background

I knew what I wanted to do with the background: it had to be a solid color, interrupted by floating objects. So the first step was to build one.

I starded by CTRL-C CTRL-Ving the sample react-three-fiber project, and started playing with ways to move the objects. Soon I had a cube following the mouse pointer!

That evolved when I found that react-three-fiber had a companion animation library, based on react-spring. It looked like I found what I was looking for: objects that followed the mouse pointer in a way that looked like natural movement. 

```tsx
type FollowerProps = {
    target: { x: number, y: number },
    tension: number,
    friction: number,
    children?: any
}

const Follower = ({ target, tension, friction, children }: FollowerProps) => {
    const { boxPosition } = useSpring({
        boxPosition: [target.x, target.y, 0],
        config: { tension, friction },
    })
    return <animated.group
        position={boxPosition}
    >
        {children}
    </animated.group >
}
```

Now for a bit of trickery: the orange halo that moves around the rings in the background is actually a point light, illuminating a plane placed behind it. Here's a side view:

The next part will focus on performance, accessibility and talk about my future plans with the site. Stay tuned!
