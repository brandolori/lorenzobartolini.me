## A little bit of context
What it Quizbero? Well, Quizbero is a web app born as a way to enhance the scope of the ReMade project. But wait, what is that supposed to be?

The ReMade project has the goal to instruct the public about Unibo ongoing effort of leaving paper in the past and embracing the digital, replacing as many traditional and paper-consuming processes with computer-based alternatives. This is archieved in a somewhat unusual way: by planting trees. Every tree planted, inside a so-called "digital garden", represents some amount of paper saved.

Now, try to imagine being a bored university student that goes for a walk through some trees. You're not gonna always care what those trees represent, are you? Not without a bit of a push. That is where Quizbero comes in! By placing small qr codes on some of the trees, those who pass by will (hopefully) be intrigued and will (even more hopefully) scan them, bringing them to a small digital experience that will (even even more hopefully) teach them something.
