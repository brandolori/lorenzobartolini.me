title: Building a minecraft server on a single board computer
date: "2021-12-08"
summary: "Come this winter, I wanted to find a place to both show off all the cool tricks I learn and write short blog stories talking about my experiences. I remembered I had a website that I only had been using to test npm packages in a production setting, and I decided to do something with it."

## An excuse
I have this single board computer at home, the [Asus Tinkerboard](https://tinker-board.asus.com). It's a small and quite powerful machine, not unlike the Raspberry Pis that kickstarted the SBC revolution. this has a bit of a _solution looking for a problem_ effect on me: when I remember it exists, I desperately try to find a reason for its existance, be it an ad-blocking dns server with [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/), or a NAS with [OpenMediaVault](https://www.openmediavault.org/) (which by the way I've never been able to get working).

Time and time again, the perfect excuse to keep it plugged to my router has been to use it as a minecraft server. This article is a brief summary of all I've learned in the (now plentiful) times I've attempted the process.

## Enter the beast
The Asus Tinkerboard (original, not S, not 2) has a quad core 32 bit ARM SOC from Rockchip, 2GB of LPDDR3 RAM, and a pretty standard IO.

It is the best kind of powerful: just powerful enough. This forces you to get creative in finding solutions and ways to optimize for your use case, which for my taste is the entire fun of the process

## Choosing an OS
Now, for SBC like these there are mainly two options when dealing with operating systems: using the manifacture-provided one or using Armbian. The first choice in this case is called Tinker OS: a Debian-based os that should offer best-case-scenario in performance and hardware access. So why did I choose Armbian instead?

Armbian is a multi-system operating system based on Debian available for a variety of single board computers. As far as I know it does not offer any measurable improvement over Tinker OS, but what it does offer is that it worked that one time that the Asus-provided OS didn't. So I guess the answer to the question is consistency?

## Coffee beans
The next step is a bit more difficult.
That is, minecraft needs Java. The first time I attempted this task, I barely knew how Java worked and tried searching for an answer on how to install it on google. This sent me spiraling in a maze of non working answers and dead-end paths
[[non ricordo se c'Ã¨ su apt-controllare]]

Until one day, I found [Jabba](https://github.com/shyiko/jabba). Shout out to my OOP course in university for suggesting it as a way to install java! It's a quite powerful tool, automatically listing the available jdk distributions for your platform and os, and letting you install and switch between them with ease. This served me well for a long time, until recently when minecraft 1.18 came out, and I was faced with the task of upgrading to Java 17.

## The Javaest of them all
So, the situation was this: Jabba relies on a .json index file to list the available java versions. This .json, located in the root folder of the repository, is updated once in a while by the jabba mantainers, and serves as the default way you fint and install java using jabba. The problem was that for some reason the index had not been updated to feature a 32 bit arm version of the Java 17 JDK, not even _one_.

At first I was afraid this was the end. It had finally come the time when nobody cared about my architecture anymore, and surely everyone had stopped building the new java for it.

But I didn't despair, and started looking for solutions. It turns out that somone was -in fact- building for arm32: Bellsoft, in the form of [Liberica](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/), among others. Still, I wanted to keep using jabba as it was a good way to upgrade java in the future, and it would take care of setting all the environment variables for me.

Fortunately the jabba developers thought of this use case, and there is a built in way to install a java distribution through a download link.

So here we are, with a fresh copy of Java 17 on our snappy new Armbian installation. How about actually getting the game on there?

## Getting the game on there
The simple answer would be to go to the [minecraft website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server), download the "vanilla" .jar and start it. This does work, but the official server is notoriously slow and inefficient, and god only knows how much we need efficiency right now. So let's try something better.

[**Spigot**](https://www.spigotmc.org/) is a faster, plugin-compatible version of a minecraft server. It features many performance improvements over vanilla, and lets you tweak the settings to configure the game to be more performance oriented if needed. But we can do better.

[**Paper**](https://papermc.io/), based on Spigot, is an even faster minecraft server, based on what I can only assume is dar wizardry. On top of all the changes that Spigot makes to the vanilla server, it adds even more modifications to make your server run even better.

There are even faster and more bleeding-edge servers out there, but the sweet spot for performance and stability seems to be Paper. To install it, you just need to go to the right page and download the latest .jar.
